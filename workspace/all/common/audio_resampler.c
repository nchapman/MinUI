 * Algorithm:
 * 1. If diff < sample_rate_out: Write frame to buffer, add sample_rate_in to diff
 * 2. If diff >= sample_rate_out: Consumed=1, subtract sample_rate_out from diff
 *
 * For upsampling (e.g., 44100 -> 48000):
 * - Some frames return consumed=0, meaning "I wrote it, give me same frame again"
 * - This duplicates frames to increase output rate
 *
 * For downsampling (e.g., 48000 -> 44100):
 * - When diff gets too high, frames are skipped (not written)
 * - consumed=1 means "advance input even though I didn't write"
 *
 * @param resampler Resampler instance with state

 * @param frame Input audio frame to process
