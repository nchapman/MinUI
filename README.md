# LessUI

> **Built on the shoulders of giants:** LessUI is a fork of [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI), the brilliant work of [Shaun Inman](https://github.com/shauninman). Shaun's vision of a distraction-free, beautifully simple retro gaming experience is what makes this project possible. This fork exists to explore new directions while honoring the elegance and philosophy of the original.

LessUI is a focused, custom launcher and libretro frontend for [a variety of retro handhelds](#supported-devices).
