# ShellCheck configuration for LessUI
# Strict but pragmatic - catch real bugs, not style nitpicks

# Disabled checks:
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source (dynamic includes, unavoidable)
# SC2046: Quote $(commands) - massive refactor, separate PR
# SC2164: cd || exit - massive refactor, separate PR
# SC2207: Prefer mapfile/read -a - intentional use for array from command output
# SC3010,SC3014: POSIX compatibility (not a concern for embedded Linux)
disable=SC1090,SC2046,SC2164,SC2207,SC3010,SC3014

# Show errors and warnings (skip info/style noise)
